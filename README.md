## 🧐 What Is snifftest?

snifftest is a friendly little tool that checks your writing for signs that it might have been created by artificial intelligence. Think of it as a writing detective. It reads through your text and points out phrases, patterns, and styles that commonly appear when AI generates content.

This tool is perfect for writers, editors, teachers, employers, or anyone who wants to make sure their words sound authentically human. It works with plain text files like those used in blogs, articles, guides, or documentation. The best part? It has zero dependencies, which means it does not require any complicated setup or additional programs to run.

## ✅ What Does snifftest Do

snifftest examines your document and flags specific writing habits that AI tends to use. Here are some examples of what it looks for:

- **Overly formal phrases** like "delve into" or "in conclusion" that sound robotic
- **Repetitive sentence structures** where every sentence follows the same pattern
- **Unnecessary transitions** such as "furthermore" or "moreover" used too frequently
- **Generic descriptions** that lack specific, human details
- **Perfect grammar everywhere** with no natural mistakes or stylistic quirks

The tool gives you a simple report listing all the suspects it found, so you can decide whether to keep or rewrite them. It puts the control in your hands.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome. If you are not a programmer, do not worry. This guide walks you through everything step by step. You only need to do three things: download the tool, run it, and then point it at your text file. Let us begin.



### 📥 Step 1: Download snifftest

Visit this link to download the application: [https://github.com/Spirounkempt95/snifftest](https://github.com/Spirounkempt95/snifftest)

This link takes you to the official page for snifftest. Look for a green button that says "Code" or "Download" and click it. Then choose "Download ZIP" or if you see a file named something like `snifftest.exe` click that instead. The download will start automatically once you pick the right option.



### 📂 Step 2: Get the File Ready

Once the download finishes, you will have a folder or a single file on your computer. If you downloaded a ZIP folder, you need to open it. Right-click on the ZIP file and select "Extract All". Windows will create a new folder with the same name. Open that folder. Inside you should see a file called `snifftest` or `snifftest.exe` or maybe a file named `snifftest.mjs`. Any of these is fine.



### ⚙️ Step 3: Run snifftest

Now for the easy part. Double-click the file you found in Step 2. If a black or blue window opens up, that is normal. It means snifftest is running. If nothing happens, try right-clicking the file and choose "Open with" then "Node.js" or "Command Prompt" depending on what you have. But usually double-click works just fine.



### 📝 Step 4: Test It On Your Writing

When snifftest runs, it will ask you to provide the path to your text file. This means you tell it which document you want to check. For example, if you have a file called `myarticle.txt` on your Desktop, you would type:

`C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\myarticle.txt`

Then press Enter. snifftest will read through your document and show you a report of all the AI telltale signs it found. You can use this information to polish your writing and make it sound more natural.



## 🛠️ How to Use snifftest Like a Pro

Here are some tips to get the most out of snifftest:

- **Save your document as a plain text file (`.txt`)** before running snifftest. It works best with simple text files, not Word documents or PDFs.
- **Run snifftest multiple times** on the same document after making changes. This helps you see if you fixed all the flagged spots.

- **Use it on short snippets** like email drafts or quick messages. Even a sentence or two can contain AI tells.
- **Combine snifftest with your own judgment.** It is a helper, not a boss. If you like a certain phrase, keep it. The tool is there to make you think, not to force you to delete things.



## 🔧 Features That Make snifftest Special

### 🧮 Countable Rules

snifftest has over 30 specific, countable rules. Each rule targets a known pattern found in AI-generated prose. For example, one rule checks for excessive use of the word "crucial". Another rule flags sentences that start with "It is important to note". These rules are precise and give you a clear, numeric score for how many times each issue appears in your document. This makes it easy to see which habits you should work on.



### 🧠 Judgment Model

In addition to the countable rules, snifftest also includes one judgment-based model. This model uses a more sophisticated approach to detect subtler patterns that are hard to define with fixed rules. It looks at the overall rhythm of your writing, the variety of sentence lengths, and the natural flow of ideas. This dual approach means snifftest catches both obvious tells and sneaky ones.



### 🪶 Zero Dependencies

This is a huge deal. Many tools require you to install separate programs, libraries, or packages before you can use them. snifftest does not. It is a single, self-contained file. That means it works immediately after you download it. No need to install anything else. No worrying about compatibility issues. This makes it incredibly easy for non-technical users.



### 🔄 Pre-Commit Hook Integration

If you are a developer or work with a team that uses GitHub, you can also set up snifftest to run automatically before code commits. This is called a pre-commit hook. It ensures that every piece of documentation or prose added to your project gets checked for AI tells before it goes live. This is a great way to maintain consistent, human-sounding content across a whole organization.



### 🤖 Works With Claude Code

snifftest was designed to integrate smoothly with Claude Code, a popular coding assistant by Anthropic. It can also be used standalone as we have shown. This makes it versatile for different workflows. Whether you are a writer checking an article or a developer reviewing auto-generated comments, snifftest fits right in.



### 🐙 GitHub Action Ready

You can even add snifftest to your GitHub repository as an automated action. This means every time someone submits a pull request with changes to documentation, snifftest will automatically review the prose and add comments to the PR about any AI tells it finds. This is a powerful way to maintain quality in open-source projects.



## 📊 Example Report

Imagine you run snifftest on a paragraph like this:

*"In today's fast-paced digital world, it is crucial to leverage cutting-edge solutions to optimize workflows and maximize efficiency. Furthermore, it is important to note that collaboration is key to success in this ever-evolving landscape."*

snifftest might produce a report like this:

```
File: sample.txt
Total AI tells found: 5

Rule: "It is crucial" (Count: 1) - Line 2
Rule:"It is important to note"(Count: 1) - Line 2
Rule:"In today's fast-paced" (Count: 1) - Line Once
Rule:"Furthermore" at sentence start(Count: Once) - Line Two
Rule:"ever-evolving" cliché(Count: Once) - Line Two

Overall judgment model score: 78% likely AI-written
```

The report tells you exactly what phrases to revise,and how severe the issue is. You can then rewrite those parts to sound more human. The result? A document that reads naturally and authentically.



## 💡 Who Should Use snifftest

- **Bloggers and content writers** who want to ensure their work does not accidentally sound robotic
- **Editors** looking for a quick first-pass review before human proofreading
- **Teachers and professors** who need to check student submissions for AI-generated content
- **Human resources professionals** reviewing cover letters or written assessments
- **Developers** who maintain documentation and want to guarantee brand voice consistency
- **Non-native English speakers** who want to avoid overly formulaic academic or business writing

Anyone who writes regularly can benefit from snifftest's insights. It is like having a smart friend who taps you on the shoulder when you slip into a robotic tone.



## 🔄 Sample Workflow

Let us walk through a complete example from start to finish.

1. You write a short article in Notepad and save it as `draft.txt` on your Desktop.
2. You double-click `snifftest` from your downloads folder.
3. A window opens asking for the file path. You type `C:\Users\Jane\Desktop\draft.txt` and press Enter.

4. Within seconds, snifftest displays a report listing 7 potential AI tells in your draft. You notice it flags the phrase "in order to" twice and "moreover" three times.
5. You open your draft in a text editor, replace those phrases with more natural alternatives, and save the file again.

6. You run snifftest once more. This time it reports only 2 tells remaining. You fix those as well.
7. You finalize your article feeling confident it sounds authentically human.The whole process took less than 10 minutes.



## ⚠️ Tips for Best Results

- **Use short, varied sentences.** AI tends to produce uniform sentence lengths. Mix in a few brief, punchy sentences with some longer ones.

- **Avoid overused transition words.** Words like "furthermore", "moreover", and "additionally" scream AI. Use them sparingly.
. **Include personal anecdotes and specific details.** AI lacks real experience. Mentioning a concrete memory or a quirky detail makes your writing unmistakably human.\n.- **Do not fear minor imperfections.** A slight grammatical quirk or an informal phrase here and there adds personality. Perfect prose is a red flag for automation.\n.- **Read your work aloud.** Your ears catch robotic rhythms that your eyes miss. snifftest just gives you a head start.\n\n## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Do I need to install anything first?\nNo. snifftest has zero dependencies.
